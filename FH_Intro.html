			<h2> <p>
			After graduating in 2020 with an engineering associates degree, I pursued further education and shifted my career towards my own artistic ambitions as an activist and artist.</p>
		<p>
			I now aim to create designs to spark 
			<br> social justice and awareness. </p></h2>
		<h3><p>
			My current goal is to further my understanding of
			User Experience and Information Design, and to integrate
			those disciplines into my work as a site designer and in
			my role in Greater Restoration as an art director and
			event coordinator.</p>
			<p>
			In my free time, I practice my skills as a character
			designer and conceptual artist, and aim to have a portfolio
			fit for studio work on a professional level. I work in Clip
			Studio Paint and focus on building a brand online as a
			freelancer and content creator. </p> </h3>
